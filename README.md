# Interview Scheduler

The Scheduler app allows a user to book an appointment for an interview on a specific day of the week. You can choose your interviewer, as well as edit or delete your appointment. 

Scheduler is a single-page, easy to use app with a clean design and interface. The app was built using React, Webpack, Babel, Axios, Storybook and Webpack Dev Server, and was tested using Jest and Cypress.
